/**
 * The contributor profile, rebuilt on the section style.
 *
 * It was nine bordered containers at near-identical weight — a header card, a
 * four-tile risk strip, and five more cards in a 2 + 1 grid — so the page had
 * nothing to lead with and no way to say which of the nine mattered.
 *
 * Three things drove the rewrite, all of them measured against a real index
 * before being changed rather than after:
 *
 * 1. **Every marker fired on nearly every row.** The hotspot flame hit 80% /
 *    70% / 55% of the top files for the three contributors with real history;
 *    the churn pill's red band hit 80% / 85% / 55%; the bus-factor scale's
 *    green band had no members at all. A badge most rows carry says nothing.
 *    The one marker left is hotspot *and* sole owner *and* ≥90% of the file's
 *    commits, which lands on 25% / 25% / 15% and names a single thing: a
 *    high-churn file this person alone maintains.
 *
 * 2. **Colour was doing work it is not allowed to do.** Lines added rendered
 *    green and lines deleted red, as though deleting code were an error; churn
 *    percentile and bus factor got the health triad for what are plain counts.
 *    Green / amber / red belong to health bands. What is left uses the accent
 *    ramp, where position carries magnitude.
 *
 * 3. **The figures restated each other.** Modules was a headline tile *and* a
 *    section; co-authors was a headline tile *and* a section. Each figure in
 *    this file now appears exactly once, in the place that can explain it:
 *    sole ownership in the lede, the three secondary reads in the column beside
 *    it, five volume figures in the ribbon, and the rest inside the section
 *    that owns the subject.
 *
 * Server-renderable: no state, no handlers, `hrefFor*` instead of `onSelect*`.
 * Every row is then a real URL that survives a middle-click, and the page above
 * it stops needing a client boundary.

 * A list of ten was the wrong shape for this data. Overlap on a real repo is
 * one partner and then a cliff — 15.8%, then 1.6%, 1.2%, 1.0%, 0.8% — so rows
 * two through ten are people who once touched the same file, presented at the
 * same weight as the person who actually shares the work. The lead partner is
 * the answer to the question the section exists for (who reviews this), and
 * the tail is honestly reported as a count rather than padded out into rows.

 * the endpoint returns the full key set, so a contributor who has never
