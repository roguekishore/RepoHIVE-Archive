/**
 * What one box's arrows actually say, in words. Pure, browser-free.
 *
 * The canvas draws a relation as a routed line whose only encoding is a
 * coupling-derived weight; the verb (`ZoomRelation.label`) was carried on the
 * wire and never rendered anywhere, so nothing on the surface said whether an
 * arrow meant "imports" or "changes at the same time as". This module turns the
 * relations incident to a node into the sentence the detail panel prints and
 * the caption the canvas key uses.
 *
 * It also reports what the per-parent cap hides. `drawEdges` shows only the
 * strongest `EDGE_MAX_PER_PARENT`, and on a real index that bites hard: 99 of
 * 218 containers have more relations than the cap, the worst holding 133. A
 * bounded view that does not say it is bounded reads as a complete one.
