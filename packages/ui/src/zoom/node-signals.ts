/**
 * What a card's two dots mean, in words. Pure, browser-free.
 *
 * A card carries two dots and nothing on the surface named either. Worse, they
 * shared a palette: the role dot painted `--color-success` for "has an entry
 * point" while the health dot painted the same token for "healthy", so a reader
 * who worked out one dot would misread the other. Colour bands belong to health
 * (one accent, two semantics), so the role dot is now a single accent dot
 * meaning "there is something here" and this module supplies the words that say
 * what.
 *
 * Naming all applicable roles also fixes a silent drop: the old dot ran a
 * priority cascade (entry > hotspot > dead > on-flow) and drew only the winner,
 * so a box that was both an entry point and a hotspot reported only "entry".
