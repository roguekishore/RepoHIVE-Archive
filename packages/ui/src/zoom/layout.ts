/**
 * Per-parent masonry pack layout. Pure, browser-free and unit-testable.
 *
 * The backend ships a containment tree but its layout rects are a squarified
 * treemap (space-filling, extreme aspect ratios). We ignore those and lay each
 * parent's children out client-side instead: every card is sized by importance
 * (more central = bigger, within bounds so nothing is unreadably small) and the
 * cards are row-packed into centred, variable-width rows. The staggered row
 * edges and the size variation give an organic architecture-map feel rather than
 * a rigid grid, while the whole cluster is uniform-fit (aspect-preserving) into
 * the parent so cards keep a single landscape shape. The rect emitted is still in
 * parent `[0,1]` space, so the clip-and-scale composition in `geometry.ts` is
 * unchanged.
