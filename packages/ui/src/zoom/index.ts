/**
 * @repohive/ui/zoom: continuous-zoom knowledge-graph canvas.
 *
 * Public entry point. Host pages mount `<ZoomCanvas data={zoomMap} />` with the
 * map fetched from `/api/graph/{repo_id}/zoom-map`. The renderer, camera and
 * pure tree/fade/cull math are exported too so downstream surfaces (and tests)
 * can reuse them. Everything except `ZoomCanvas` and `renderer`/`theme` is
 * browser-free and unit-testable in isolation.
