// Which layer of the architecture spine a page belongs to, and how to group a
// list of pages by it.
//
// The wiki does not write a page per layer, so a module cannot be parented onto
// one. Instead every module and cycle is stamped at generation time with the
// layer that claims it, and the reader-facing groupings are built from those
// stamps — which means the grouping survives the absence of any layer page.
//
// The order of the layers themselves is a property of the repository, computed
// once from its import graph and recorded on the overview page. It is read from
// there rather than re-derived (or alphabetised, which would put "API" above
// "Runtime" and say something untrue about the dependency direction).
