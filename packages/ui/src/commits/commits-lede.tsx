 * lead with: "Commits 4,912 / High priority 1,637 / Fix commits 1,204 / Avg
 * entropy 0.42" is four numbers at 24px, one of them a bare 0.42 whose
 * two-word caption ("change diffusion") did not say what it measured or which
 * direction was bad.
 *
 * The headline is the review backlog rather than the commit count, because
 * that is the thing this page exists to work through. Every figure here is
 * server-computed over the whole history: reducing the loaded page instead
 * would under-count fixes and, since the feed defaults to risk-sorted and is
 * therefore entirely top-tercile, would report the high-priority share as
 * roughly 100%.
 *
 * No median score: `CommitStats` does not carry one, and deriving it from the
 * histogram bins would be an estimate printed as a measurement.
