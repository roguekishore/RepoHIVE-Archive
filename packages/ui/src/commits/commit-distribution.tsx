 * The two views of how the change-risk score behaves in this repo.
 *
 * They stay a pair. The histogram says where the tercile cuts fall, the
 * scatter says what commit shape lands you above them, and neither answers the
 * question alone — showing one leaves a half-width chart beside dead space,
 * which is the empty state the old collapsible produced whenever a repo
 * predated the histogram aggregate.
 *
 * This lives in the shared package rather than in the web app because it is
 * mostly *content*: two headings and two paragraphs explaining a scoring model
 * that behaves identically wherever it runs. Left in the app, a second surface
 * showing the same charts had to copy the prose, and a copied explanation of a
 * model is an explanation that drifts out of step with it.
 *
 * Portability: it takes data and one callback. The host owns how a selected
 * commit is expressed — the OSS web app writes `?commit=` for its detail sheet
 * to pick up — so there is no platform flag here and no dead branch.
