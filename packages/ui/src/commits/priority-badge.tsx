// All three lost their fill. The queue defaults to risk-sorted, so the first
// screen is by construction almost entirely "Elevated": a tinted amber pill on
// every row stopped marking anything and just turned the leftmost column into
// a block of colour competing with the subjects beside it. A dot plus a word
// carries the same three-way distinction at a fraction of the ink, and the
// pill still reads as elevated when one turns up further down a date-sorted
// page, which is where it actually needs to catch the eye.
