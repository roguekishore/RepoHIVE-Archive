 * users cannot even reach.
 *
 * Measured against snapshots rather than against the last sync *timestamp*,
 * which is the version that does not work: a commit only appears in the index
 * once a sync has ingested it, and that same sync stamps `last_sync_at`, so
 * "commits newer than the last sync" is zero by construction. Decisions are
 * worse — they are created *by* the sync run. Snapshot deltas are the figures
 * that actually change.
 *
 * Renders nothing without two snapshots to compare, or when nothing moved: an
 * all-zeroes strip is noise pretending to be news.
