/**
 * `metrics` merges rather than replaces, so a fixture names only the counts its

 * broke every fixture that set any of them, which is what happened to
 * `descendant_count`.
 *
 * The return is not cast. The `as ZoomNode` that used to sit here accepted an
 * object that did not describe a `ZoomNode` at all: `metrics` was missing
 * `descendant_count`, `summary` was null against a `string`, `importance` and
 * `sibling_rank` were absent, and `rect` is not a field (the node's box is
 * `layout`). Only the one override call site ever errored, and only in the
 * type-check job, which does not run on pull requests.
