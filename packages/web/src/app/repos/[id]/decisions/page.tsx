 * Architectural decisions.
 *
 * The page used to open with a title and go straight into a filter bar, then
 * close with a React Flow canvas of the decision graph. Neither said the thing
 * the data says loudest: most records here are unconfirmed *proposals* mined by
 * the indexer, and only a handful are confirmed. That makes this a triage
 * queue, not an archive, and the lede now says so.
 *
 * Every figure comes from `/decisions/counts`, a grouped COUNT. An earlier cut
 * counted the rows it had fetched and printed "97 of 100" on a repository
 * holding several hundred — a count nobody measured, on the surface whose whole
 * job is to be trusted.
 *
 * The canvas is gone. See `decision-governance.tsx` for what its payload
 * actually contained and why two lists beat it.
