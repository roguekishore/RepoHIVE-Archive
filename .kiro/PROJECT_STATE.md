## Current position

- **Phase:** Review 2 — core grouping algorithm (not yet started; `packages/core` is empty).
- **Recently done:** Review 1 parser complete (`packages/shared` + `packages/parser` → `graph.json`,
  102 tests) per BRAIN 2026-07-01. This session (2026-07-06): stood up the **Basic Memory
  task-documentation + memory system** in `.kiro/` (see Done).
- **Next review:** Second Review — **15.07.2026** — deliverable: **algorithm** (`group` → `index/`).
- **Next action:** Write `hierarchical-repository-grouping/tasks.md` (currently empty), then implement
  `packages/core` (adaptive preserve-vs-reconstruct grouping → `index/`).

---

## Done

- [x] Master plan written (`.kiro/PROJECT_PLAN.md`).
- [x] Removed nested `.git` repos from both MCP servers (functionality intact).
- [x] Reorganized workspace: `tooling/` (MCP servers), `docs/reference/` (brief + v3 deck),
      `archive/` (resume + old decks). Updated `mcp.json` paths; servers re-enabled.
- [x] Steering docs created: product, architecture, tech-stack, performance-and-scale,
      competitive-landscape, roadmap, review-timeline, git-workflow.
- [x] State ledger, AGENTS.md, doc seeds, root config, folder spine created.
- [x] Existing core spec: Graphify → RepoHIVE rename.
- [x] **Review 1 parser complete** (`packages/shared` + `packages/parser`; Tree-Sitter Java →
      `graph.json`; determinism harness; 102 tests) — per BRAIN 2026-07-01.
- [x] **Basic Memory task-documentation + memory system** set up in `.kiro/` (2026-07-06):
      `steering/task-workflow.md`; skills `task-researcher` + `handoff-generator` (`.kiro/skills/`);
      CLI agents `.kiro/agents/{task-researcher,handoff-generator}.json`; SessionStart hook
      `load-memory-on-start.json`. Backed by the external `personal` vault (`D:\Vaults\personal-brain`).

## In progress

- Review 2 (core algorithm): `hierarchical-repository-grouping` spec has requirements + design;
  `tasks.md` is empty and `packages/core` is unbuilt.
- **Awaiting owner:** (1) paste `basic-memory` into `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (agent write-blocked) +
  reload window; (2) optional: simplify the contract's agile item_types/phases to a lighter academic
  set (the de-tracker/de-Zoho pass itself is done); (3) optional: hide `templates/` from the Obsidian graph.

## Next up (Review 1 — Parser)

- [ ] `dependency-graph-parser` spec: requirements → design → tasks.
- [ ] `packages/shared`: JSON-contract types (GraphNode, DependencyEdge, etc.).
- [ ] `packages/parser`: Tree-Sitter Java → stitch → `graph.json`.
- [ ] Pick a small open-source Java repo as `fixtures/sample-java-project`.

## Known gaps / open questions

- **Parser produces the graph that the core algorithm consumes** — must target the existing spec's
  exact schema. (Resolved decision; flagged here as a reminder during build.)
- Frequency signals (import/call/shared-type) start simple; sharpen later.
- Git not yet initialized (will set up with the user, walking through each step).
- Final project name **RepoHIVE** locked; command names still TBD (placeholders in use).

## Decisions log (most recent first)

- **2026-07-07** — Completed the Task-10 de-tracker adaptation: full de-Zoho/DE-Ixxxx pass on the vault
  templates (rewrote task-record/adr/test-matrix/work-item-format; renamed `zoho-handoff.md` →
  `handoff.md`; fixed the `00-index` link; contract `format_version` 1→2). Kept the delivery structure,
  de-branded it; vault + `.kiro/` verified free of zoho/DE-Ixxxx/sprint. Open: optionally simplify the
  agile item_types/phases to a lighter academic set.
- **2026-07-06** — Scope clarification: **RepoHIVE has no "sprint" concept, ever.** Removed all sprint
  references from the Basic Memory vault templates (`task-record.md`: dropped `sprint:` frontmatter,
  "sprint item" → "work item", `[[Epic or Sprint]]` → `[[Parent work item]]`; `work-item-format.md`:
  "Zoho Sprints tree" → "delivery tree"). The `.kiro/` machinery I created never used sprints.
  Remaining Zoho/DE-Ixxxx tracker language in the templates is left pending the Task-10 keep-vs-adapt call.
- **2026-07-06** — Replicated the AI task-documentation + memory system (from a company repo) into
  RepoHIVE's `.kiro/`, adapted to this project: steering `task-workflow.md`, skills
  `task-researcher`/`handoff-generator`, CLI agents (JSON, 7-key shape), and a SessionStart
  `load-memory-on-start` hook over the external Basic Memory `personal` vault. Additive to (not a
  replacement for) PROJECT_STATE/BRAIN/diary/research-log. Vault contract `work-item-format.md` left
  Zoho-flavored pending an owner keep-vs-adapt decision; `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` edit deferred to
  the owner (agent write-blocked).
- **2026-07-04** — Added `commit-assist` hook (userTriggered): proposes convention-based commits on
  confirmation. Chosen over postTaskExecution auto-commit. `log-task-completion` keep/remove: pending.
- **2026-07-04** — Documented commit convention in `git-workflow.md`: product types
  (`feat/fix/test/refactor/chore`) vs `kiro(...)` meta type; commit memory/state files on `main`.
- **2026-07-04** — Logging switched to 24-hour timestamps (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`) across hooks + rules.
- **2026-07-04** — Expanded `sync-docs-on-stop` hook (v2): PROJECT_STATE + BRAIN auto-updated;
  research-log + project-diary are draft-for-approval only (plagiarism-safe, human-owned artifacts).
- **2026-06-22** — Project name finalized: **RepoHIVE** (Repository Hierarchical Indexing &
  Visualization Engine). Replaces the FlowGraph placeholder across all docs. Command names remain TBD.
- **2026-06-22** — Stack finalized: TS/Node, Tree-Sitter, graphology, Louvain/Leiden, React/React
  Flow, JSON storage, npm workspaces. MySQL removed. Neo4j deferred to 8th sem.
- **2026-06-22** — Graphify researched: it's 63K-star prior art with single global Leiden clustering;
  our edge narrowed to adaptive multi-level hierarchy + determinism; Graphify becomes our baseline;
  validated the no-embeddings decision.
- **2026-06-22** — Embeddings deferred to a semantic search/naming layer; never for grouping.
- **2026-06-22** — Cloud/auth not needed for core; telemetry deferred; skill = top distribution lever.
- **2026-06-22** — Path 1 (degree + paper) chosen now; Path 2 (viral) deferred, architecture kept open.
- **2026-06-22** — Workspace reorganized; backbone docs generated.
